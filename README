ABOUT

ch-server is a small, simple web server.

It supports CGI programs each at an individually configured URI and serving of
static files from a single document root with no virtual hosts.

It is intended to be suitable for web-accessible service health check scripts
and other quite targeted cases on systems which would not otherwise have a web
server installed.

It makes use of the fine work of Paul Seamons (PAUSE/CPAN ID: RHANDOM) on the
Net::Server distribution of Perl modules.
